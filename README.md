# Tiffcolors

This is a VS code theme inspired by SynthWave 84, made for people with
deuteranopia (red-green colorblindness). I made it mostly for myself,
but if anybody else finds it useful then that's great.

## Features

- Colors picked specifically for being easy to distinguish for
  colorblind people.
- Supports semantic highlighting for various languages, such as Rust,
  C++, TypeScript, etc.

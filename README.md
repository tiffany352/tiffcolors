This is a VS code theme made for people with deuteranopia (red-green
colorblindness). I made it mostly for myself, but if anybody else finds
it useful then that's great.

## Features

- Colors picked specifically for being easy to distinguish for
  colorblind people.
- Supports semantic highlighting for various languages, such as Rust,
  C++, TypeScript, etc.

# Thanks

This theme was inspired by SynthWave '84, and originally started as a
set of color tweaks to it. The main yellow color (#fede5d) comes from
there as well.
